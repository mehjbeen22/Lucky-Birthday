# Project Title: Lucky Date Checker

# Description:
The "Lucky Date Checker" project is a simple web application built using Vanilla JavaScript that allows users to input their date of birth and a lucky number. The application then checks whether the sum of the digits in the date of birth is divisible by the given lucky number. If the sum is divisible, the application informs the user that their date of birth is considered lucky; otherwise, it notifies them that their date of birth is not lucky.

# Key Features:

1) User-friendly interface with input fields for date of birth and lucky number.
2) Dynamic calculation of the sum of digits in the provided date of birth.
3) Real-time evaluation to determine if the calculated sum is divisible by the lucky number.
4) Instant feedback to the user about the luckiness of their date of birth.
5) Utilizes basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight and responsive experience.
6) Suitable for educational purposes to learn about web development fundamentals.

# How to Use:
1) Enter your date of birth using the provided date picker.
2) Input a lucky number that you believe could influence the luckiness of your date of birth.
Click the "Check" button.
3) The application will instantly display a message indicating whether your date of birth is considered lucky according to the criteria.

# Learning Outcome:
This project provides an opportunity for individuals new to web development to practice their skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to capture user input, perform calculations, and provide real-time feedback using basic scripting. Additionally, the project encourages experimentation and further customization to enhance its functionality and design
